Developer notes — TypeScript/JSDoc & Cucumber World types

What I added

- jsconfig.json (at repo root) — configures the TypeScript language service for a JS project and points to the local `types` folder.
- types/world.d.ts — declares a global `CustomWorld` interface describing `this` inside Cucumber step callbacks (page, poManager, page objects, utils).

How this helps

- VS Code's TypeScript language server now knows the runtime "world" shape used by Cucumber steps. That means you don't need inline JSDoc casts when assigning page objects from your POManager.
- Use `/** @this {CustomWorld} */` on step callbacks so the editor knows what `this` refers to.

Recommended patterns

1) Annotate step callbacks that access `this`:

```js
Then('some step', /** @this {CustomWorld} */ async function () {
  // `this.poManager` and `this.searchResultsPage` are typed
  await this.searchResultsPage.headerSearchForm.click();
});
```

2) Prefer local typed variables when helpful (optional):

```js
/** @this {CustomWorld} */
async function stepImpl() {
  const poManager = this.poManager; // typed via world.d.ts
  const searchResultsPage = poManager.getSearchResultsPage();
  await searchResultsPage.headerSearchForm.click();
}
```

3) If IntelliSense doesn't appear immediately, restart the TypeScript server in VS Code:

- Open Command Palette → "TypeScript: Restart TS Server"

Troubleshooting

- Make sure VS Code workspace root is the repo root (so `jsconfig.json` is picked up).
- If a page-object module doesn't export a type-friendly API, add JSDoc comments to that file or convert it to an exported class.

If you'd like, I can:
- Remove any remaining `@this` annotations and rely solely on the global `CustomWorld` (but `@this` is explicit).
- Add examples to your `features/` folder showing the preferred pattern.
